# Master Computer for Double-Joint Planar Robotic Arm Control System

A basic GUI-based control system for planar dual-joint robotic arms, developed and completed on June 6, 2023 as part of my coursework.

## Project Overview
This master computer system implements precise control algorithms for planar dual-joint robotic manipulators, featuring:

- ​**Multi-mode Motion Control**:
  - Linear interpolation for straight-path movements
  - Cubic spline interpolation for smooth curved trajectories
  - Manual jogging control with position reset functionality
  - Hand-drawn path following using image processing

- ​**User-Friendly Interface**:
  - Real-time arm position visualization
  - Dynamic trajectory preview window
  - Emergency stop and safety zone configuration
  - Position logging and history recall
